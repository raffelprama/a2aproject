# Development Log for A2A Employee Information System

## [YYYY-MM-DD] Initial Setup
- Created `SRS.md` with detailed software requirements specification.
- Created `README.md` with project overview and setup instructions.
- Created `log.md` to track project progress and changes.

## [YYYY-MM-DD] Next Steps
- Implement `remote_agent.py` (FastAPI server for employee data).
- Implement `client_agent.py` (CLI client for querying employee data).
- Add requirements.txt or pyproject.toml for dependencies. 

## [YYYY-MM-DD] LangGraph & LLM Integration
- Integrated LangGraph and dekallm LLM (Qwen/qwen25-72b-instruct) into remote_agent.py for query understanding and employee search.
- Updated client_agent.py to optionally use the same LLM for parsing user queries before sending to the remote agent.
