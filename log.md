# Development Log for A2A Employee Information System

## [YYYY-MM-DD] Initial Setup
- Created `SRS.md` with detailed software requirements specification.
- Created `README.md` with project overview and setup instructions.
- Created `log.md` to track project progress and changes.

## [YYYY-MM-DD] Next Steps
- Implement `remote_agent.py` (FastAPI server for employee data).
- Implement `client_agent.py` (CLI client for querying employee data).
- Add requirements.txt or pyproject.toml for dependencies. 

## [YYYY-MM-DD] LangGraph & LLM Integration
- Integrated LangGraph and dekallm LLM (Qwen/qwen25-72b-instruct) into remote_agent.py for query understanding and employee search.
- Updated client_agent.py to optionally use the same LLM for parsing user queries before sending to the remote agent. 

## [YYYY-MM-DD] LangGraph State Schema Fix & Docs Update
- Fixed remote_agent.py by adding a state schema (Pydantic BaseModel) for LangGraph initialization.
- Updated README.md to document .env usage and new dependencies (python-dotenv, pydantic). 

## [YYYY-MM-DD] V2 Implementation - Multi-Agent System
- **SRS V2**: Updated SRS.md to specify three-agent architecture with Employee Info Agent, HR Agent, and enhanced Client Agent with routing.
- **HR Data**: Created `hr_dummy_data.py` with comprehensive HR data including:
  - Salary information (30 records with base_salary, currency, bonus_eligibility)
  - Job hierarchy data (reporting structures, levels)
  - Work schedules (including night shifts and weekend shifts)
- **HR Agent**: Implemented `hr_agent.py` with:
  - FastAPI server on port 8001
  - Three specialized tools: salary_search_tool, hierarchy_search_tool, schedule_search_tool
  - LangGraph integration with router for query type determination
  - LLM integration for query parsing
- **Client Agent V2**: Created `client_agent_v2.py` with:
  - Intelligent query routing between Employee Info Agent and HR Agent
  - Keyword-based routing (salary, hierarchy, schedule keywords)
  - Support for both agent endpoints
  - Enhanced error handling and user experience
- **Documentation**: Updated README.md to reflect V2 system architecture and usage examples.
- **System Architecture**: Now supports distributed three-agent system with intelligent routing.

## [2025-07-30] Next Steps for V2
- Test the complete three-agent system
- Add integration tests
- Consider adding more specialized agents (IT Support, Legal, etc.)
- Implement persistent database integration
- Add more sophisticated query routing using LLM

## [2025-07-30] V4 Implementation - LLM-Powered Processing
- **Client Agent V4**: Created `client_agent_v4.py` with full LLM integration:
  - **Query Clarification**: LLM processes user input to clarify vague queries (e.g., "bob salary" â†’ "What is Bob Johnson's salary?")
  - **Smart Routing**: LLM determines optimal agent routing strategy (employee, hr, or multi_agent)
  - **Criteria Extraction**: LLM extracts search parameters from natural language queries
  - **Natural Response Generation**: LLM converts raw data into conversational, natural language responses
  - **Multi-Agent Integration**: Seamlessly combines data from multiple agents with context awareness
- **Enhanced User Experience**: 
  - Natural language input support
  - Conversational responses instead of formatted output
  - Context-aware responses that understand query intent
  - Better error handling with natural language explanations
- **LLM Processing Flow**:
  1. Input clarification and improvement
  2. Intelligent routing decision
  3. Multi-agent data collection
  4. Natural language response generation
- **Documentation**: Updated README.md to reflect V4 features and LLM-powered capabilities
- **System Evolution**: Now supports four client agent versions (V1-V4) with increasing intelligence and natural language processing capabilities

## [2025-07-30] Next Steps for V4
- Test LLM-powered query clarification with various input types
- Optimize LLM prompts for better accuracy
- Add support for more complex multi-step queries
- Consider adding conversation memory for follow-up questions
- Implement advanced error recovery using LLM
